# Recap

- Q: When does a React component re-render?
- fyi - RSC can be compatible with functional React, but only if backend is node
- Let's look again at last week's exercise of [Putting it all together](https://unit06-lesson05.netlify.app/11)
   - üëÄ use of TS
   - could have stored all info (name, username, avatar etc.), but for learning purposes only, just chose to store array of type Person:
   ```ts
    export type PersonType = { 
      name: string;
      isFollowing?: boolean 
    }
   ```

# useEffect (pg.1)
Use to sync things outside the UI ex: browser tab title

- Q: If React is responsible for producing UI, how would we change the browser tab title since the `<title>` tag falls outside of React's `<div id="root"></div>`
- Side Effects: anytime we want to do something that's outside of React's responsibilities but we still want synchronized with our React component's state
- `useEffect` is a hook where we pass a callback function; React calls it after each render
- should pass at least an empty dependency array to ensure it'll only run after first render

## Exercise
- hard code the browser's tab to show `Home page`
  ```jsx
  import { useEffect } from 'react'

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Home page`
  }, []); // Note: the empty deps array ensures this code will run ONLY once on initial render
  ```

# useEffect (pg.2)
use as a Watcher

- `useEffect` always runs after the first time 
- BUT `useEffect` allows us to watch particular variables so that when they change, it runs.  - The way we watch these declare variable *dependencies* is via an array
- Do you remember Tommy's example of how the select dropdown only console logged only the previous state variable but not the current selected city?  How to `console.log` the actual updated state variable?

## Exercise
Refactor our Counter button example such that the browser tab also shows the latest count
 
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `${count}`;
  }, [count]);
  ```
- Try removing the dependency `count` i.e. `}, []);` - do you get a console error?

# useEffect (pg.3) 
multiple useEffects

- Similar to how you can have multiple `useState` statements, you can multiple `useEffect` statements

## Exercise
- Create a basic signup form with name and email input boxes
- Create basic `useState` variables for both fields
- Use `useEffect` such that if name changes, `console.log` that change in name
- Ensure that the name field is logged out only when the name field changes and not the email field (Tip: can use multiple `useEffect` calls)

# useEffect (pg.4)
Use to fetch JSON

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function getData() {
    fetch(/* some API */);
  }

  const res = await getData();
  const data = res.json();
  setWhatever(datas)
})
```

# useEffect (pg.4)
Use to keep track of window's width/height

- in this case, if you `addEventListener` yourself, to prevent memory leaks, you must remember to clean up via `removeEventListener`

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    setWindowSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

# Exercise:
see https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

- Create app that displays recipe categories
- Upon clicking a category, app will display recipes related to that category
- Upon clicking a recipe, app will display that recipe
- Optional: use a UI library like Material UI, PrimeReact, or other.  Otherwise customize CSS via CSS modules.

# Homework

Use `useEffect` to:
- start/show an interval timer (remember to clean up to clear the interval when React component unmounts)
- show if browser is online/offline via checking `navigator.onLine` and `window.addEventListener('online')`
- auto-save form data to localStorage every few seconds or on change
- Start working on your React Weather App assignment
