# Recap

- fyi - RSC can be compatible with functional React, but only if backend is node
- Let's look again at last week's exercise of [Putting it all together](https://unit06-lesson05.netlify.app/11)
   - üëÄ use of TS
   - could have stored all info (name, username, avatar etc.), but for learning purposes only, just chose to store array of type Person:
   ```ts
    export type PersonType = { 
      name: string;
      isFollowing?: boolean 
    }
   ```

# useEffect (pg.1)
Use to update browser tab title

- Q: So we know React is responible for producing UI on the page, but how would we change the browser tab title `document.title = 'Home page'` for example? (since the `<title>` tag falls outside of React's `<div id="root"></div>`)
- Side Effects: anytime we want to do something that's outside of React's responsibilities but we still want synchronized with our React component's state

  ```jsx
  import { useEffect } from 'react'

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Home page`
  });
  ```

# Exercise: useEffect to change document.title

- Refactor our Counter button example such that the browser tab also shows the latest counter

# useEffect (pg.2)
Use to fetch JSON

# useEffect (pg.3)
use as a Watcher

---
transition: slide-left
---

# useEffect (pg.4)
Use to keep track of window's width/height

- in this case, if you `addEventListener` yourself, to prevent memory leaks, you must remember to clean up via `removeEventListener`

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    setWindowSize({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight });
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

# Exercise:

- Create app that displays recipe categories
- Upon clicking a category, app will display recipies related to that category
- Upon clicking a recipe, app will display that recipe

# Homework

Use `useEffect` to:
- start/show an interval timer (remember to clean up to clear the interval when React component unmounts)
- show if browser is online/offline via checking `navigator.onLine` and `window.addEventListener('online')`
- auto-save form data to localStorage every few seconds or on change
- Start working on your React Weather App assignment
